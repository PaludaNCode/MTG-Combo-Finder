# MTG Combo Finder

Paste a Magic: The Gathering decklist and find the combos hiding in it — plus
**ranked suggestions for which single card to add to unlock the most new combos**.
A bit like [Commander Spellbook](https://commanderspellbook.com/)'s "Find My Combos",
because it literally asks Commander Spellbook's public API about your deck.

## Features

- **Combos in your deck** — every known combo your current 99 (or 60) can already pull off,
  with what it produces, how it works, and a link to the combo's Spellbook page.
- **Suggested additions** — every combo you're *one card away* from, aggregated per missing
  card and ranked: "add Rings of Brighthearth → unlocks 4 combos". Each suggestion links to
  the card's EDHREC and Scryfall pages and expands to show exactly which combos it enables.
- **Outside your color identity** — the same ranking for cards that would require changing
  your deck's colors, shown separately.
- **Deck import** — paste an Archidekt deck URL, or paste any site's text export
  (Moxfield, Arena, MTGO `SB:` lines, TappedOut/Deckstats/MTGGoldfish plain exports).

## How it works

Static site, zero dependencies, no build step:

- `index.html` / `style.css` — the page.
- `parser.js` — decklist parsing (`DeckParser`). Understands plain names, `1x Card`,
  Moxfield/Arena exports (`1 Sol Ring (C21) 263 *F*`), `Commander:` / `Sideboard:`
  sections, MTGO `SB:` prefixes, comments, Moxfield + Archidekt API payloads, and
  deck URLs. Runs under Node so it's unit-testable.
- `combos.js` — combo-result analysis (`DeckCombos`): turns the API's "almost included"
  variants into the ranked add-this-card suggestions (front-face matching for
  double-faced cards, ties broken alphabetically).
- `app.js` — reads the form, POSTs `{ commanders, main }` to
  `backend.commanderspellbook.com/find-my-combos`, renders the sections above.
  On failure it shows a copyable report (endpoint, HTTP status, response body,
  what was sent, which lines were skipped) instead of a bare "it didn't work".

### API contract notes

Verified against [the backend source](https://github.com/SpaceCowMedia/commander-spellbook-backend),
because guessing here cost a silent bug:

- The response is **paginated** — the payload is under `results`.
- Its keys are **snake_case**: `included`, `almost_included`,
  `almost_included_by_adding_colors`. Reading `almostIncluded` returns
  `undefined`, which renders as "no suggestions" rather than an error, so this
  failed silently for a while. `pick()` reads snake_case with a camelCase fallback.
- A variant's cards are `uses[].card.name`; its results are `produces[].feature.name`.
- Request limits (`common/serializers.py`): 600 main entries, 12 commanders,
  256-char names, and **quantity must be ≥ 1** — violations are a 400.

## Data-source research (why Commander Spellbook only)

Commander Spellbook is *the* community combo database — other combo sites are fronts for
the same data rather than independent sources:

- [EDHREC's combo feature](https://edhrec.com/combos) is officially powered by
  Commander Spellbook (see [EDHREC's own guide](https://edhrec.com/guides/how-to-use-commander-spellbook-the-combo-search-engine)).
  We link each suggested card to EDHREC for popularity/synergy context instead.
- Third-party finders like [Nerd Leagues](https://www.nerdleagues.com/combos) and
  [combo-finder.com](https://combo-finder.com/) also consume Spellbook data.
- The backend is open source: [SpaceCowMedia/commander-spellbook-backend](https://github.com/SpaceCowMedia/commander-spellbook-backend);
  API root at [backend.commanderspellbook.com](https://backend.commanderspellbook.com/).

So "multi-site" here means multi-site **deck import** (Archidekt URL via its
[public API](https://archidekt.com/api/decks/), text exports from everything else) rather
than multiple combo databases.

### Why Moxfield URLs can't be loaded

Moxfield has no public API and deliberately gates `api2.moxfield.com`: requests need a
User-Agent it whitelists on request, behind Cloudflare bot protection
([moxfield-public#143](https://github.com/moxfield/moxfield-public/issues/143)). A browser
can't satisfy either — `fetch` forbids setting `User-Agent`, a Cloudflare challenge can't be
answered cross-origin, and no CORS headers come back. That's a deliberate access policy, not
a bug to work around, so the app detects Moxfield links and points at the deck's Export
instead of burning a request that cannot succeed. Routing through a public CORS proxy would
circumvent that policy and put user decklists through an unrelated third party, so we don't.
Loading Moxfield decks properly would need a small server of our own with a whitelisted
User-Agent — a real option, but it ends the zero-backend design.

## Commands

```bash
# Unit tests (node:test, zero deps)
npm test

# Syntax-check everything (same as CI)
for f in $(git ls-files '*.js'); do node --check "$f"; done

# Run locally: it's a static page, any file server works
npx serve .   # or python3 -m http.server
```

## Branching strategy

Same as [MTG-Pricerunner](https://github.com/PaludaNCode/MTG-Pricerunner): trunk-based,
short-lived branches.

1. Branch off `main`: `feat/<thing>` or `fix/<thing>`
2. Push, open a PR — CI runs (`checks` job: JS syntax check + unit tests)
3. Merge when green. Merging to `main` **is** the release: the deploy workflow fires
   on push to `main` and publishes to GitHub Pages (once Pages is available — see
   Deploying below).

`main` should be protected: PRs need the `checks` job green before merge; force-pushes
and deletion blocked. **Not enabled yet** — flip it on under
Settings → Branches → Add branch ruleset (require status checks: `checks`) when ready;
until then the flow above is convention. Repo admins can push directly in a pinch
(escape hatch — prefer PRs).

## Deploying

`.github/workflows/deploy.yml` publishes the repo root to GitHub Pages on every push
to `main`. Note: GitHub Pages on a **private** repo requires a paid GitHub plan —
either make the repo public or run the page locally until then.

All combo data and the combo search itself come from the amazing
