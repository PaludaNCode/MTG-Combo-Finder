# MTG Combo Finder

**▶ Live site: https://paludancode.github.io/MTG-Combo-Finder/**

Paste a Magic: The Gathering decklist and find the combos hiding in it — plus
**ranked suggestions for which single card to add to unlock the most new combos**.
A bit like [Commander Spellbook](https://commanderspellbook.com/)'s "Find My Combos",
but the matching happens in your browser against a published copy of their
database — see [Why the data is published, not queried live](#why-the-data-is-published-not-queried-live).

## Features

- **Combos in your deck** — every known combo your current 99 (or 60) can already pull off,
  with what it produces, how it works, and a link to the combo's Spellbook page.
- **Suggested additions** — every combo you're *one card away* from, aggregated per missing
  card and ranked: "add Rings of Brighthearth → unlocks 4 combos". Each suggestion links to
  the card's EDHREC and Scryfall pages and expands to show exactly which combos it enables.
- **Outside your color identity** — the same ranking for cards that would require changing
  your deck's colors, shown separately.
- **Deck import** — paste an Archidekt deck URL, or paste any site's text export
  (Moxfield, Arena, MTGO `SB:` lines, TappedOut/Deckstats/MTGGoldfish plain exports).
- **Cards carrying your combos** — every card that takes part in a combo you can
  already assemble, ranked by how many. A list of combos hides this: cutting a
  card that turns up in four of them costs four combos, which is exactly what
  you want to know before trimming a deck.
- **Collapsible results** — every section header is a collapse control, and what
  you close stays closed (kept in `localStorage`) across searches and visits.
- **What a combo gives you**, as chips rather than a comma-run: game-ending
  results sort first and are highlighted, duplicates collapse, and anything past
  the fourth folds behind "+N more".

### Cleaning up combo results

Two steps, because the raw data is noisy in two different ways:

1. **At fetch time**, results whose `Feature.status` is `HU`/`PU` are dropped.
   Those are Commander Spellbook's *utilities* — internal scaffolding for
   variant generation ("mana abilities can be activated"), not things a player
   cares about. Their own `Feature.is_utility` draws the same line. If a variant
   lists nothing but utilities, they're kept, since a combo with no stated
   result is worse than a vague one.
2. **At render time**, `summarizeResults()` dedupes case- and
   whitespace-insensitively and sorts results into three tiers.

Their wording is left intact — rewriting "Infinite ETB triggers" into something
snappier risks claiming the combo does something it doesn't.

### Three tiers, three colours

| Colour | Tier | Meaning | Examples |
|---|---|---|---|
| 🟩 Green | `win` | The combo says it ends the game | *Win the game*, *Each opponent loses the game* |
| 🟨 Greyish-yellow | `decisive` | Worth having, but needs something else to convert it | mana (every flavour), storm count, creature tokens, +1/+1 counters, card draw, lifegain, damage, mill, turns |
| ⬜ Grey | `other` | The plumbing the loop runs on — relevant, but not a way to win | *Infinite ETB*, *Infinite LTB*, *Infinite death triggers*, *Infinite sacrifice triggers* |

Grey is shown, not hidden. Up to eight results are listed before the rest fold
behind "+N more" — enough for 93% of combos outright — and `splitResults()`
guarantees a tier that exists never disappears entirely into the fold, so the
plumbing stays visible even on a combo that produces a dozen things.

A binary would be wrong in both directions. **Infinite lifegain beats almost
every deck, but poison ignores life totals entirely, and mill or an alternate
win condition goes straight over the top of it.** Calling it a win is false in
exactly the games where the distinction matters; calling it plumbing undersells
it everywhere else. So the middle tier carries *why* each result still needs
something, shown on hover — infinite mana needs a payoff, infinite mill needs
one too (and loses to Thassa's Oracle), infinite turns still has to close.

Grey is deliberately the four biggest outcomes in the database — ETB (66k
combos), LTB (57k), death triggers (45k), sacrifice triggers (43k). They explain
*how* a loop works, which is not the same as why you'd run it, and leaving them
quiet is what keeps the chips readable.

Two traps worth knowing about, both pinned by tests:

- A result must be **unbounded** to reach yellow. "Draw a card" is not "Infinite
  card draw".
- **"Lose the game" in a negation is not a win.** *You can't lose the game due
  to having 0 or less life* says the words while meaning the opposite, and
  *unless an opponent chooses to lose the game* hands them the choice. Matching
  on the words alone coloured all of those green.

## Layout

One column on phones and tablets; from 900px the decklist sits in a sticky left
column beside the results, so you can edit the list while reading suggestions.
Section headers are 48px tall for thumbs, and `tools/verify-layout.js` asserts
all of it — see Commands.

The layout test loads the page in a **sized iframe** rather than resizing the
browser window: media queries follow the iframe's width, and the full Chrome
build silently clamps `--window-size` to 500px, which quietly turned a "390px"
run into a 500px one that proved nothing.

## How it works

Static site, zero dependencies, no build step:

- `index.html` / `style.css` — the page.
- `parser.js` — decklist parsing (`DeckParser`). Understands plain names, `1x Card`,
  Moxfield/Arena exports (`1 Sol Ring (C21) 263 *F*`), `Commander:` / `Sideboard:`
  sections, MTGO `SB:` prefixes, comments, Moxfield + Archidekt API payloads, and
  deck URLs. Runs under Node so it's unit-testable.
- `combos.js` — combo-result analysis (`DeckCombos`): turns the API's "almost included"
  variants into the ranked add-this-card suggestions (front-face matching for
  double-faced cards, ties broken alphabetically).
- `app.js` — reads the form, downloads the combo database, renders the sections
  above. On failure it shows a copyable report (endpoint, HTTP status, what was
  sent, which lines were skipped) instead of a bare "it didn't work".
- `tools/fetch-combos.js` — downloads Commander Spellbook's bulk export and
  writes a compact `combos.json`. Run by CI, not by the page.

## Why the data is published, not queried live

Commander Spellbook's API only accepts **browser** requests from their own site
and localhost:

```python
# backend/backend/production_settings.py
CORS_ALLOWED_ORIGIN_REGEXES = [
    r'^https://(\w+\.)?commanderspellbook\.com$',
    r'https?://localhost:\d+',
]
```

A page served from `paludancode.github.io` is not on that list, so the browser
refuses to send the request and the fetch fails with no status at all — Safari
words it "Load failed". Nothing client-side can change that; it is their server's
allowlist.

CORS applies to browsers, not to servers, so `.github/workflows/update-data.yml`
fetches the database in CI instead and force-pushes `combos.json` as a single
orphan commit to the **`data` branch**. The page reads it from
`raw.githubusercontent.com` and does the deck matching itself in `combos.js`
(complete combos / one card short / one card short but off-colour), which is
what the `find-my-combos` endpoint would have done server-side. This is the same
split [MTG-Pricerunner](https://github.com/PaludaNCode/MTG-Pricerunner) uses for
prices. The `data` branch is a build artifact — never branch from it or PR into it.

Consequences worth knowing:

- Combo data is as fresh as the last workflow run (daily cron + manual dispatch),
  not live.
- Combos requiring a *template* ("any sacrifice outlet") are excluded from
  suggestions, since no single named card completes them.
- Deck colour identity is derived from the commander's entry in the dataset. An
  unrecognized commander disables colour filtering rather than hiding results.

### Use the bulk export, never the paged API

The fetcher reads **`https://json.commanderspellbook.com/variants.json`** — the same
bulk file Commander Spellbook's own frontend uses (see `combo-sitemap.xml.ts` in
[commander-spellbook-site](https://github.com/SpaceCowMedia/commander-spellbook-site)).
One request for the whole database.

That file is **over 512 MB**, which is past the longest string V8 will build, so
`res.json()` dies with `Cannot create a string longer than 0x1fffffe8 characters`.
`tools/fetch-combos.js` therefore streams the response and pulls out one variant
object at a time with a small hand-written scanner (no dependencies), keeping only
the object currently being read in memory. `test/scanner.test.js` feeds it chunk
sizes down to a single byte, including braces and escaped quotes inside strings.

Do not "improve" this by paging `/variants` instead. That needs ~300 requests and
their rate limit is a **cumulative quota, not a per-second throttle**: walking it at
4 req/s was cut off after 120 pages, and slowing to 1 req/s was cut off *earlier*,
at 78, with two full minutes of backoff never clearing it. Fewer, larger requests
is both the only thing that works and the neighbourly way to consume someone else's
database.

### Colour identity comes from Scryfall

Commander Spellbook's `CardSerializer` exposes name, images and type line but
**not** colour identity, so the combo export alone cannot tell you whether a
suggested card fits your commander's colours. `tools/fetch-combos.js` therefore
also streams [Scryfall's oracle-cards bulk file](https://scryfall.com/docs/api/bulk-data)
and publishes a name → identity map alongside the combos.

The first published dataset had `cardIdentity: {}` because the fetcher looked for
a `card.identity` field that does not exist, and the guard around it turned that
into an empty map rather than an error — colour filtering was simply inert. The
fetcher now refuses to publish with fewer than 1,000 identities.

### API contract notes

Verified against [the backend source](https://github.com/SpaceCowMedia/commander-spellbook-backend):

- The wire format is **camelCase**, even though the Python dicts are snake_case —
  `CamelCaseJSONRenderer` is the default renderer, and the bulk export camelizes too.
  Reading the Python source alone is misleading here. The fetcher accepts either spelling.
- A variant's cards are `uses[].card.name`; results are `produces[].feature.name`.

## Data-source research (why Commander Spellbook only)

Commander Spellbook is *the* community combo database — other combo sites are fronts for
the same data rather than independent sources:

- [EDHREC's combo feature](https://edhrec.com/combos) is officially powered by
  Commander Spellbook (see [EDHREC's own guide](https://edhrec.com/guides/how-to-use-commander-spellbook-the-combo-search-engine)).
  We link each suggested card to EDHREC for popularity/synergy context instead.
- Third-party finders like [Nerd Leagues](https://www.nerdleagues.com/combos) and
  [combo-finder.com](https://combo-finder.com/) also consume Spellbook data.
- The backend is open source: [SpaceCowMedia/commander-spellbook-backend](https://github.com/SpaceCowMedia/commander-spellbook-backend);
  API root at [backend.commanderspellbook.com](https://backend.commanderspellbook.com/).

So "multi-site" here means multi-site **deck import** (Archidekt URL via its
[public API](https://archidekt.com/api/decks/), text exports from everything else) rather
than multiple combo databases.

### Why Moxfield URLs can't be loaded

Moxfield has no public API and deliberately gates `api2.moxfield.com`: requests need a
User-Agent it whitelists on request, behind Cloudflare bot protection
([moxfield-public#143](https://github.com/moxfield/moxfield-public/issues/143)). A browser
can't satisfy either — `fetch` forbids setting `User-Agent`, a Cloudflare challenge can't be
answered cross-origin, and no CORS headers come back. That's a deliberate access policy, not
a bug to work around, so the app detects Moxfield links and points at the deck's Export
instead of burning a request that cannot succeed. Routing through a public CORS proxy would
circumvent that policy and put user decklists through an unrelated third party, so we don't.
Loading Moxfield decks properly would need a small server of our own with a whitelisted
User-Agent — a real option, but it ends the zero-backend design.

## Commands

```bash
# Build the combo database locally (one large download)
node tools/fetch-combos.js

# Unit tests (node:test, zero deps)
npm test

# Layout smoke test — REQUIRED after any UI change. Renders the real page at
# 390/768/1440 px and fails on horizontal overflow, a collapse control that
# doesn't collapse, or the desktop columns not splitting.
npm run verify

# Syntax-check everything (same as CI)
for f in $(git ls-files '*.js'); do node --check "$f"; done

# Run locally: it's a static page, any file server works
npx serve .   # or python3 -m http.server
```

## Branching strategy

Same as [MTG-Pricerunner](https://github.com/PaludaNCode/MTG-Pricerunner): trunk-based,
short-lived branches.

1. Branch off `main`: `feat/<thing>` or `fix/<thing>`
2. Push, open a PR — CI runs (`checks` job: JS syntax check + unit tests)
3. Merge when green. Merging to `main` **is** the release: the deploy workflow fires
   on push to `main` and publishes to GitHub Pages (once Pages is available — see
   Deploying below).

`main` should be protected: PRs need the `checks` job green before merge; force-pushes
and deletion blocked. **Not enabled yet** — flip it on under
Settings → Branches → Add branch ruleset (require status checks: `checks`) when ready;
until then the flow above is convention. Repo admins can push directly in a pinch
(escape hatch — prefer PRs).

## Deploying

`.github/workflows/deploy.yml` publishes the repo root to GitHub Pages on every push
to `main`. Note: GitHub Pages on a **private** repo requires a paid GitHub plan —
either make the repo public or run the page locally until then.
