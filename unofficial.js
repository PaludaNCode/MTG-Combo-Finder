// Combos this project believes in that Commander Spellbook has not published.
//
// Everything else on the page comes from Spellbook's variants file and is shown on
// their authority. This file is the exception, and it exists because their coverage
// has holes: two cards that do the same thing are not always written into the same
// combos, so a deck holding one of them is told about a line while a deck holding
// the other is told nothing.
//
// The holes are found by substitution. Take two cards that appear interchangeably
// across many published combos — Soul Warden and Essence Warden share 97.5% of
// theirs — and any combo that names one but not the other is a candidate. Most
// candidates are not gaps: the cards turn out to differ in a way that matters to
// that particular loop, and the audit in the README lists the 35 of 44 that were
// ruled out and why. What survives is here — the nine below.
//
// Each row therefore carries its own evidence rather than asking to be taken on
// trust, and the page shows it: the published combo it was derived from, which card
// was swapped for which, and how far the checking actually went.
//
//   verified  the swap was checked against both cards' oracle text
//   derived   both halves of the swap are separately published, but the specific
//             pairing has not been read against the card text
//
// A row disappears from this file's output the moment Spellbook publishes the same
// card set — see matchUnofficial() in combos.js. That is deliberate: these should
// graduate rather than accumulate, and a duplicate on screen would be worse than
// no entry at all.

  // 1,514 published combos while Hammerhead is in none. Writing 1,514 rows by hand
  // would be absurd and would rot the moment Spellbook published the 1,515th.
  //
  // So a rule instead, expanded against the dataset the page has already loaded:
  // wherever a published combo uses `substituteFor`, the same combo works with
  // `card`. See matchSubstitutions() in combos.js.
